            <p class="about-text">
                I wanted to make this specially for you both. I know it's kinda corny but y'all should know it comes from the deepest parts of my heart. I know we've been through a lot, and I mean A LOT!, but time has shown that those downs were just our path to make it to the highest we are now.
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                Love you guys a lot. Never had such a friendship like we have, and all in such a short time. It's kinda crazy to look back. All of this in this tiny amount of time, how close we've come, and how much we still have to go further; and yes, we have made errors, but we (especially me) have learned from them.
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                But if I had the chance to meet you guys again, I would make every single decision again, and again. Every mistake, every success, the exact same. Why? Because that's the path that led us here. That let me understand the dos and don'ts. That let me get slightly, ever so slowly, step by step, to what we are today.
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                I really think, deep down, that I don't deserve to have any of you guys in my life. Such beautiful people, both inside and outside. Just with the fingers of one hand I could count the people I met with the heart that you both have, and I'll still have some fingers to spare.
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                Thank you for letting me be part of your lives. For letting me share myself and discover things I wouldn't have without the help of you. For letting me learn from the bad and become someone better. I have so much to learn, and, with the help of you, wish to learn even more (without so many setbacks, of course XD).
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                My only wish for this Christmas is that next year brings us even closer, with more laughs and fewer "learning experiences".
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                It's been so long and so little time that it feels like we met yesterday. From the bottom of my heart, I wish you a very happy Christmas!!
            </p>

            <br>

            <p class="about-text">
                Sincerely (and a bit literally) yours, Bryan. &lt;3
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                P.D. I hope you liked the fireworks
